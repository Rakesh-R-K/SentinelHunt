Day 9 – Alert Triage & Analyst Contextualization

Objective:
Convert raw detection alerts into SOC-ready, human-readable security intelligence.

Work Done:
- Enriched alerts with unique alert IDs and timestamps
- Added severity, confidence, and clear reasoning fields
- Introduced threat-type classification for faster triage
- Embedded full flow context (IP, port, protocol)
- Generated analyst-consumable JSON alert output

Outcome:
Alerts are now explainable, traceable, and actionable, suitable for SOC-style
triage and investigation workflows.
